						<p>While Koalas are often referred to as bears, they are actually <em>marsupials</em>. Koalas are herbivorous and like eating eucalypt leaves. Because they get so little energy for their diet, koalas must limit their energy use and sleep about 20 hours a day. They spent most of that time in trees. Koalas are asocial and spent only 15 min a day on social behavior. </p>
